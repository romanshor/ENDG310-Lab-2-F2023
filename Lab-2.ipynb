    "In this lab, you will analyze global $CO_2$ data and Canadian forest fire data utilizing datasets from the Government of Canada and from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  \n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "After completing this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Checkout, commit, and sync a github repository.  \n",
    "- Load and plot data from csv and xls files.\n",
    "- Manipulate data and find statistics.\n",
    "- Create an visual infographic that summarizes your interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab submission\n",
    "This lab is due at 5:00 PM on Friday, September 29th via github.  Be sure to **commit** and **push** your final code.  You submit the following:\n",
    "- all code you used, either as `ipynb` or `py` files.\n",
    "- a README.md file, properly formatted with headings and explainations, which summarizes the lab and your results and must include your final infographic.\n",

The simplest data source is the summary statistics from Natural Resources Canada, found __[here](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart/download/nfdbpnt)__.  Data from 2022 and estimated data for 2023 will need to be appended manually as the data only goes through 2021.
